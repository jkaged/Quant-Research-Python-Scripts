# 📊 Quant Research Practice – Python Scripts

This repository contains a collection of practice Python scripts for sample scenarios commonly encountered by **quantitative researchers**. These exercises are designed to help strengthen my problem-solving, data analysis, and modeling skills using Python.

## 📌 What’s Included

- 📈 Statistical analysis and signal processing
- 🧠 Machine learning models for finance
- 💡 Factor models and alpha signal generation
- 🧮 Portfolio optimization techniques
- 🔁 Backtesting and performance evaluation

Each script is standalone and includes comments for clarity and learning.

## 🧠 Purpose

The goal of this project is to:

- Practice solving real-world quant problems using Python
- Build a reference library for interview prep and future work
- Improve fluency in tools like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy / pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
- cvxpy (for optimization problems)

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quant-python-practice.git
cd quant-python-practice
````

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run any script from the `/scripts` directory:

```bash
python scripts/mean_variance_optimization.py
```

## 📂 Folder Structure
